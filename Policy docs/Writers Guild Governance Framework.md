## I. Spirit and Philosophy  
### Culture  
The Writers Guild seeks to foster a culture where creativity, experimentation,
and play intersect to provide meaningful opportunities for our members to
contribute writing and editing services for BanklessDAO and external partners.
The Guild will encourage and support members to create and build new projects
that promote the DAO’s mission of onboarding 1 billion people to the Bankless
lifestyle.  

### Governance  
Thoughtful governance means creating a flexible and secure framework that
evolves as the Guild moves towards on-chain governance. A culture of
experimentation and a marketplace of ideas is essential to ensure we continue
to develop mechanisms for decision-making and task management. We should aim
to maintain only the minimum viable bureaucracy (MVB) in our actions and
decisions. MVB promotes decentralization, transparency, and autonomy.  

## II. Purpose  
This Governance Framework provides guidance for Writers Guild members
regarding the organization and operations of the Guild, including the
management of labor and funding of projects within the Guild.  

## III. Guild Membership  
There are three Writers Guild membership tiers: Pupil, Scribbler, and Scribe.
Membership tiers will be denoted using Discord role tags. Guild membership is
independent of DAO membership. Guest pass holders can hold any membership
tier within Writers Guild.

### A. Pupil  
Has the Writers Guild tag but is not actively participating.  

Cannot participate in governance polls or volunteer for paid activities such
as elected roles, Client Services, Newsletter Team, or EPA. To move to
Scribbler, a Pupil can request the role tag from a DAO Level 2 Contributor
working within the Guild.  

### B. Scribbler  
1. Has the Writers Guild tag and wishes to start contributing to Guild
activities and conversations.
2. May participate in Guild-wide Coordinape Epochs.
3. Cannot participate in elected roles, governance polls or Client Services.

Any DAO Level 2 Contributor working within the Guild may change a Scribbler
to Scribe once the above tasks are completed. Promotees must provide evidence
for their contributions. (multi-sig payments, witness, or otherwise)

### C. Scribe
1. Has the Writers Guild tag and has demonstrated proficiency and reliability.
2. Scribe status may be awarded immediately upon the completion of any three
(3) paid tasks, where “any” is qualified by literally any task completed and
paid out by the Guild’s, Newsletter’s, or EPA’s multisigs. Due to the nature
of the work with Good Morning News (hereafter, GMN), this amounts to six (6)
paid tasks, where two (2) GMN tasks equate to one (1) Guild task.
3. Can participate in all Guild activities, including, but not limited to:
- acting as a signatory on the Guild multi-sig wallet.
- being nominated for elected Roles.
- working for Client Services.
- voting on all governance matters.
4. Once awarded, Scribe status may be maintained for six (6) months from date
of award. Upon completion of three (3) tasks within a given season, Scribe
status is renewed for another six (6) months. Scribes may maintain their
status indefinitely by regularly completing the minimum required tasks each
season per Article III Section C2.

## IV. Plagiarism  
Plagiarism is not tolerated in the Writers Guild. Writers who have copied or
otherwise passed work as their own have one opportunity to correct their
error. Second offense will result in demotion from Scribe to Scribbler if
the offender is a Scribe, or expulsion from the Guild if the offender is not
a Scribe.  

The formal chain of escalation to challenge the accusation is:
1. Project Leads.
2. EPA Staff Editors Circle.
3. Ombuds Office.
Each level of escalation has discretion to make the final call on whether or
not the plagiarism was intentional.

## V. Guild Treasury Multi-Sig
The multisig is set at 7 signers, held by the 7 role holders of the Guild. 5
of 7 signatures are needed to execute a transaction.

Term limits for designated signers are equivalent to the term limits for role
holders.

### Lazy Consensus
At the end of each Season, there will be a temperature check via soft
consensus poll to ratify the existing multi-sig signers. Any signer can opt
to retire from their role, triggering an election for that position.
If any Scribe votes “no” for the ratification of a particular signer, an
election will be triggered for that position. During a Season, multi-sig
signers can voluntarily retire or be removed, triggering the election process.

## VI. Elected Roles
Role holders carry out paid responsibilities which have been identified as
crucial for the operational success of the Guild. The descriptions and responsibilities of role holders are as follows:
1. Role holders are paid a salary from the Guild Treasury.
2. Role holders are required to keep record of their responsibilities and the
tools needed to perform them. This record will be updated at the end of each season or upon the role holder’s departure.

// TODO: update this section with reference to lazy consensus rules
3. There will be a Seasonal Lazy Consensus check for all Role holders. If
there are no other nominations for the next Season’s Roles, the current Role
holders may continue in their tenure. If another Scribe is nominated, an
election will be held. Role holders are determined by the election process in
Section V.

4. Roles have term limits of 4 consecutive seasons. Role holders can serve
for 4 seasons but cannot serve for a 5th. After a season has passed where
they do not hold the same role, they may run and hold the office for another
4 seasons if elected.
5. If a role holder has an unannounced absence for greater than 8 days (no
messages or communication), the responsibilities of that role holder will be
bountied out via the Role Holder's Bounty pool over the next 2 weeks. If the
Role Holder does not return to resume their duties within the aforementioned
2 weeks, an election will be held to replace them. Throughout the election
period, the duties of the role holder will be bountied out and paid for via
the Role Holder's salary. This election will take the form of an off-cycle
election as stipulated in Article V Section C.
6. Writers Guild Roles  

6a. Guild Coordinator  
Chief of Guild Morale: responsible for fostering the Guild’s culture; being
the Guild’s primary point of contact; facilitating Guild meetings and
distributing POAPs; producing seasonal Guild budgets; action items; producing
the Writers Guild newsletter; and providing Community Call updates.  

6b. Director of Talent Management  
The Warm Welcome: responsible for onboarding new members, administering the
writing and editing tests, continually refining onboarding procedures,
helping new members find their best place in the guild, and scouting talent
to perform jobs brought to the Guild from inside the DAO. For more
information, see the [December 20, 2021 edition of The Scribe’s Quill](https://banklessdaoupdates.substack.com/p/the-scribes-quill-december-20-2021).  

6c. Treasurer
Scribe of Scribes: responsible for all payouts and multi-sig outflow
(Newsletter, EPA, and Client Services), Scribe/Scribbler list management,
treasury log, submitting Writers Guild multi-sig transactions, and
remuneration payment schedule.  

6d. Governance Coordinator  
Conductor of Consensus: responsible for mapping the future of Guild
Governance, moderating and coordinating elections, serving as Ombuds
Ambassador in the case of impeachment, and coordinating Governance meetings
when applicable.  

7. Role Apprentice Bounties
The Role Apprentice Bounties serve two functions:
a. Incentivize Guild members to provide support for Role holders if the Role
holder needs assistance in performing their duties.
b. Help maintain awareness of each Role’s responsibilities such that
institutional knowledge is not lost.
Role holders are responsible for creating Apprentice Bounties for tasks they
need assistance in performing. Scribes and Scribblers can claim bounties for
completing tasks the Role holder needs assistance in performing.

## VII. Elections
### A. Elections Overview:
On-Cycle Elections: Held in the last few weeks of every Season
Off-Cycle Elections: Held mid-Season
In cases where the Governance Coordinator role is up for election, the Guild
Coordinator will preside over the election process. If both roles are up for
election, the Governance Coordinator will ask an Ombudsman to preside over
the election.

### B. On-Cycle Elections
On-cycle elections will primarily be managed by Lazy Consensus, as defined in
Article V Section A1.
At the end of each Season, role holders (Guild roles and multi-sig signers)
wishing to maintain their role into the next Season will be subject to a Lazy
Consensus check. The Lazy Consensus check for each role will be completed via
a Discord poll, administered and monitored by the Governance Coordinator.
The poll will remain open for one week.
Participation in this poll will be limited to Scribes.
If voters are unanimously in favor of continued tenure, then the role holder
is confirmed for the upcoming season, barring those who have served their
limit of 4 consecutive seasons, as outlined in Article IV Section 4. Should a
role holder choose to retire at the end of the season, this will initiate the
election process (as described in Part D) for that role, to decide a new role
holder for the upcoming season.

### C. Off-Cycle Elections
Voluntary retirement
Should a role holder or multi-sig signer decide to retire mid-season they
must inform the Governance Coordinator. Retirement will initiate the election
process for that role, beginning with the nomination process described in
Article V Section D2. The role holder must continue to fulfill their duties
(if even by Bounty) until after the election has concluded.  

Involuntary Retirement
1. Any Scribe can make a mid-season proposal to remove a role holder, which
must be seconded by any other Scribe. This proposal to remove and its
seconding can be initiated in the Guild governance Discord channel or via
private direct message to the Governance Coordinator, or in the case of a
motion to dismiss the Governance Coordinator, the proposal and its seconding
should be brought to the attention of the Guild Coordinator who will
administrate the removal and replacement of the Governance Coordinator.
2. If the proposal has arisen from interpersonal conflicts, then the
Governance Coordinator and DAO Ombuds team will work together to resolve the
conflict. After Ombuds makes a recommendation, the involved parties will have
the opportunity to resolve their disputes with each other. If an accord is
not met, an election will be held.
3. If the proposal to remove a role holder from their position has arisen due
to an operational transgression (e.g. fraud or collusion), there will be a
public discussion period of one week during which the Guild will vote to
determine their culpability and recommend a resolution. If a resolution is
not reached following the public discussion period, this will initiate the
Election Process as described in Article V Section D.

### D. Election Process
1. Lazy Consensus (1 week)
A poll will be created to maintain the incumbent as the role holder. If one
person votes “No,” an election is triggered.  

2. Nomination Period (1 week)
a. Scribes may nominate their peers (other Scribes) to be a role holder.
Scribes may not nominate themselves. They must be nominated by another Scribe.
b. During the one week period, voters may choose to support retention of the
current role holder OR nominate another Scribe for that role.
c. Nominations for the role will be collected via a channel or thread on
Discord, administered and monitored by the Governance Coordinator.
d. Participation in this process will be limited to Scribes.
e. Nominees may accept or deny the nomination. If they accept, they must
provide a statement detailing the following:
- Contributions to the Guild and DAO
- Qualifications/relevant experience for the position
- Why they want to be elected
- Additional sponsors (preferred, but not required)
f. All nominees who accept their nominations will be informed by the
Governance Coordinator of the statement requirement and deadline for
submission. A nominee who does not provide the required material in time will
be deemed to have denied the nomination.
g. Statements must be submitted to the Governance Coordinator, who will hold
them and release the statements in a dedicated Discord thread on the first
day of the election.
g. In the case of an election to replace the Governance Coordinator, the
Guild Goordinator will manage all of the above with regard to the election.  

3. Election Period (1 week)
a. The election for each role will be completed via a Discord poll,
administered and monitored by the Governance Coordinator.
b. The poll will remain open for one week.
c. Participation in this poll will be limited to Scribes.
d. In the event of a tie, there will be a 3-day run-off election. Candidates
are expected to present a “platform” piece about what they will do in office.
In the event of another tie, the winner will be chosen via the hand-to-hand
combat or Super Smash Brothers Melee (Governance Coordinator’s choice).

## VIII. Quorum

1. Quorum for Season 6 is set at 10% of Tier 3 membership. In event of a
fraction, the calculated amount will be rounded down to the nearest whole
number. Current Tier 3 membership is 50 members, so polls must reach a
minimum of 5 votes to attain quorum and qualify for ratification.
2. Quorum for all polls and elections is set in the first week of each season
at a percentage of that season’s Tier 3 membership, as calculated on day 1 of
the season. The Governance Coordinator will work with the Guild Treasurer,
Guild Coordinator, and Talent Scout to determine quorum and will announce the
season’s quorum during that week’s governance updates.
3. At the end of each season, participation in governance polls and elections
will be evaluated by the Governance Coordinator. In the case of improved
participation, a proposal will be put forth to the membership to raise
quorum, to take effect the following season, thereby increasing legitimacy
for amendments and addendums being enacted. In the case of reduced
participation, a proposal will be put forth to reduce quorum for the
following season, and it will become the Governance Coordinator’s priority to
address the reduction in governance participation. These proposals should run
simultaneously with end-of-season elections. See Article V Section D.
4. Upon ratification of the seasonal evaluation of quorum, Article VI Section
A will be revised with the appropriate values.

## IX. Projects
1. Projects will manage their own governance frameworks and guidelines.
2. New Projects asking WG for funds must follow the Writers Guild Program
